    <h2>About This Project</h2>
    <p>The idea behind this tool is to help content creators determine the reaction of their audience to a new video that
      they would want to publish, based on metrics like likes, dislikes, views, comments, etc. correlated to videos in
      similar categories.</p>
    <p>We also want to provide suggestions on how they can improve their videos based on the best relevant videos.</p>
    <p>The tool can also help detect any guideline violations and other aspects that may lead a creator to get strikes or
      demonetization.</p>
    <h3>Problem or Opportunity</h3>
    <p>Content creators are increasingly facing an issue where they receive guideline violation notifications after their
      video gets published, which leads to them facing penalties and sometimes losing access to the site where they have
      built their audience. We believe this can be avoided, and this tool can help the creators ensure that their videos
      are as compliant as possible.</p>
    <p>Moreover, a creator can use this tool to get predicted insights into their new videos so they can understand if
      their videos are lacking in any way or they should change something to garner a more positive response. The tool
      will do this by analyzing trending content across popular social and media platforms based on the same topic. We
      don't expect this tool to be accurate here, as we cannot determine human reactions after all, but we simply aim to
      provide some help to the content creators in this area.</p>
    <p>Finally, just determining a rating for their video is not good enough, so we want to help provide suggestions as
      well that will inspire creators to hone their videos and create better than they ever could.</p>
